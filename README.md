# Messaging APP

A RESTful API for sending messages across an organization

## Setup
1. npm install
2. npm run setup
3. npm run seed
4. npm start

Once you are in, log into one of the pre-made accounts to see how the system works!
Once you are familiar, feel free to make your own accounts to distribute to your friends and send messages!

The API should be good to go! Try to send username and password (in seed.js) at http://localhost:3000/login to get a token,
then try out our various endpoints detailed below
